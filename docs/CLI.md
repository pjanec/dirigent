# Commands
Dirigent can be controlled remotely using commands.

The commands can come from different sources:
  1. Dirigent UI
  2. Command line client app called Dirigent.CLI
  3. Over TCP connection from a remote control app.

Commands are received by Dirigent master agent. The master then asks dirigent agent app to perform necessary operations on the machines affected by the command.

## Command Line Interface

CLI uses a text formatted line based commands.

There can be one or more (semicolon separated) commands per line but a single command cannot span multiple lines.


### StartApp

Starts given app if not already running. The general syntax is as follows:

	StartApp <appId>[@<planid>] [<varlist>]

Note: the app might get restarted if already running with different set of explicit env vars - see `LeaveRunningWithPrevVars` option.

Note: "LaunchApp" is an alias for StartApp.

#### App definitions from different plans

If just the app name is specified, the app is launched with settings defined by the recent plan the app was started from.

	StartApp m1.a

If the plan name is specified after the ampersand character, Dirigent starts given app with the parameters as defined in given plan (and not those used for the most recent launch)

	StartApp m1.a@plan1

If an empty plan is explicitly specified (the ampersand character present but no plan name follows), Dirigent uses the standalone app definition if available (see `Standalone apps` description - they are the `<app>` elements defined outside of any plan in the SharedConfig.xml) 

	StartApp m1.a@

#### Explicit Environment Variables

If the list of variables is present, those variables are passed as environment variable to the process started. They can also be used for expansion of the app's `CmdLineArgs` and `ExeFullPath` attributes in the SharedConfig.

	StartApp m1.a VAR1=VALUE1
	StartApp m1.a VAR1=VALUE1::VAR2=VALUE2

If the list of values is missing, the app can be optionally started with the most recently used explicit env. variables  - if the `ReusePrevVars=1` option is specified in the app definition. Without the option the app will be started without any explicit env var (unless they are specified on the command line).

If you want to explicitly avoid using the variable specified before, pass `::` as the variable list. Or you specify the variable value with empty value:

	StartApp m1.a ::
	StartApp m1.a VAR1=

Variable value strings containing spaces need to be enclosed in double-quotes. The outer double-quotes are removed. To add a double-quote character in the variable body, use two successive double-quotes.

	StartApp m1.a@plan1 VAR1="VALUE ""1"""::VAR2="VALUE 2"

The result will be like:

    VAR1=VALUE "1"
    VAR2=VALUE 2


### KillApp

Kills given app

  `KillApp <appId>`

##### Example

    KillApp m1.a

### RestartApp

Restarts given app. Optionally passing a new list of values.

  `RestartApp <appId> [varlist]`

If the list of values is missing, the app can be optionally started with the most recent explicit environment variables used. See the `StartApp` description for more details on explicit environment variables handling.

##### Example

    RestartApp m1.a
    RestartApp m1.a VAR1=VALUE1
    RestartApp m1.a VAR1=VALUE1::VAR2=VALUE2
    RestartApp m1.a VAR1=
    RestartApp m1.a ::

### StartPlan

Starts given plan, i.e. start launching apps according the plan rules

  `StartPlan <planName> [<varlist>]` 

If the varlist is specified, the variables are set to each app started from this plan.

See the `StartApp` chapter for more details on how the explicit environment variables are handled.

If you want to clear the variable specified before, you pass '::' as a varlist.

##### Example

    StartPlan plan1
    StartPlan plan1 VAR1=VALUE1
    StartPlan plan1 VAR1="VALUE ""1"""::VAR2="VALUE 2"
    StartPlan plan1 ::

### StopPlan

Stops starting next applications from the plan and evaluating the plan status.

This DOES NOT kill any app! 

  `StopPlan <planName>`

##### Example

    StopPlan plan1

### KillPlan

Kills given plans (kills all its apps)

  `KillPlan <planName>` 

##### Example

    KillPlan plan1

### RestartPlan

Kills all apps from the plan and starts the plan again.

  `RestartPlan <planName> [<varlist>]` 

If the varlist is specified, the variables are set to each app started from this plan.

If you want to clear the variable specified before, you pass '::' as a varlist.

##### Example

    RestartPlan m1.a
    RestartPlan m1.a VAR1=VALUE1
    RestartPlan m1.a VAR1="VALUE ""1"""::VAR2="VALUE 2"
    RestartPlan m1.a 

### GetAppState

  `GetAppState <appName>`   returns the status of given app

##### Response text

  `APP:<AppName>:<Flags>:<ExitCode>:<StatusAge>:<%CPU>:<%GPU>:<MemoryMB>:<PlanName>`


###### Flags

   Each letter represents one status flag. If letter is missing, flag is cleared.

  `S` = started

  `F` = start failed

  `R` = running

  `K` = killed

  `D` = dying

  `I` = initialized

  `P` = plan applied

  `X` = restarting


###### ExitCode

Integer number of the last exit code. Valid only if app has exited, i.e. Started but not Running, zero otherwise.

###### StatusAge

Number of seconds since last update of the app state

###### CPU

Float percentage of CPU usage

###### GPU

Float percentage of GPU usage [NOT IMPLEMENTED, zero]

###### MemoryMB

Float number of MBytes od system RAM used


###### PlanName

  The name of plan in whose context the app was most recently launched.

##### Example

  Request:   `GetAppState m1.a1`

  Response:     `APP:m1.a:SIP:255:10.1:34.7:82.5:7623.7:plan1`




### GetAllAppsState

  `GetAllAppsState` ...... returns status of all apps known to dirigent 

**Response text**

One line per application (see GetAppState command). The last line is "END\n"

    APP:m1.a:SIP:1:0.45:20.1:0:7623.2:plan1
    APP:m1.b::0:0:0:65.2:
    END

### GetPlanState

Returns the status of given plan

  `GetPlanState <planName>`  

##### Response text

  `PLAN:<planName>:<status>`

##### Example

  Request:   `GetPlanState plan1`

  Response:     `PLAN:plan1:Success`

### GetAllPlansState

Gathers the status of all plans known to the Dirigent

  `GetAllPlansState` 

##### Response text

Returns one line per plan; last line is "END\n"

	PLAN:plan1:None
	PLAN:plan2:Success
	PLAN:plan3:Killing
	END

### GetClientState

Returns the status of given client/machine

  `GetClientState <machineId>`  

##### Response text

  `CLIENT:<ClientName>:<IsConnected>:<ReportedSecondsAgo>:<IP address>`

##### Example

  Request:   `GetClientState m1`

  Response:     `CLIENT:m1:1:0.5:127.0.0.1`

### GetAllClientsState

Gathers the status of all clients/machines known to the Dirigent.

  `GetAllClientsState` 

##### Response text

Returns one line per client/machine; last line is "END\n"

	CLIENT:m1:1:0.3:192.168.1.1
	CLIENT:m2:0:2.7:192.168.1.2
	END

### SetVars

Sets environment variable(s) to be inherited by the processes launched afterwards. Changes Dirigent's environment so it is applied to all process started later.

Note: This is a different set of variables than the explicit variables that can be set as part of `StartApp` or `RestartApp` commands.

Multiple variables can be set at once , separated by '::'.

String containing spaces need to be enclosed in double-quotes. The outer double-qotes are removed. To add a double-quote character in the variable body, use two successive double-quotes.

Once set, the environment variables stays set until they are changed. Each process started by Dirigent will inherit all those variables.

To unset a variable, you need to set it to an empty value (VAR1=)

  `SetVars <varlist>`

##### Examples

	SetVars VAR1=VALUE1
	SetVars VAR1="VALUE ""1"""::VAR2="VALUE 2"
	SetVars VAR1=
	SetVars VAR1=::VAR2=


### KillAll

Kills all running apps on all computers, stops all plans

  `KillAll` 

If defined in the [KillAll section](SharedConfig.md#KillAll-definitions) of the SharedConfig.xml, it also takes a set of extra actions.

### ReloadSharedConfig

Reloads the shared config.

If *file* option is used, dirigent will load this file (otherwise the currently used one gets reloaded).

If *killApps* option is "1", Dirigent tries to kill all apps before reloading the shared config. Default = "1".

If *killApps* is not specified or 0, the reload does not affect the apps that are already running. Should the app definition change, it is applied the next time the app is started/restarted.

  `ReloadSharedConfig  [file=c:\Path\To\SharedConfig.xml] [killApps=0|1]`

##### Examples

	ReloadSharedConfig
	ReloadSharedConfig killApps=0
	ReloadSharedConfig file=C:\dirigent\sharedConfig.xml killApps=0

### Shutdown

Reboots or shuts down all computers where the dirigent agent is running or just one specified machine.

 `Shutdown mode=PowerOff|Reboot` [machineId=<machineId>]`

##### Examples

	Shutdown mode=PowerOff
	Shutdown mode=Reboot machineId=m1

### Terminate

Terminates Dirigent agents on all the computers (or just on specified machine), optionally killing all the apps managed by the Dirigent. To be used before reinstalling the dirigent app.

 `Terminate [killApps=0|1] [machineId=<machineId>]`

If *killApps* option is "1", Dirigent tries to kill all apps before terminating itself. Default = "0".

Warning: Dirigent does not make sure the apps really get killed. It terminates itself right after issuing the kill command to the operating system for each of the running app managed by the Dirigent.

If *machineId* options is given, terminates the agent just on that machine. Of empty or missing, the Dirigent terminates it agents and GUIs on all machines. Default: empty.

##### Examples

	Terminate
	Terminate killApps=1
	Terminate machineId=PC-1
	Terminate machineId=PC-1 killApps=1


### ApplyPlan

Changes the app definitions to the one from given plan. Applies the plan either to all apps from the plan or just one single app from the plan (if appIdTuple is present).

 `ApplyPlan <planName> [<appIdTuple>]`

If *appIdTuple* is missing, the app definition will be updated for all the apps in the plan. If present, just that app will be updated.

##### Remarks

The app definition from the plan will be used on the next start of the app. Until then the previously set app definitions will be used, potentially coming from different plan or from the standalone app definitions.

Affects also the DIRIGENT_PLAN environment variable which is set when the app is started.

##### Examples

	ApplyPlan plan1
	ApplyPlan plan1 m1.a

### SelectPlan

Informs the Dirigent about the plan selection in a GUI.

 `SelectPlan <planName>`

##### Remarks

Dirigent performs actions related to a plan selection. For example it might execute the `ApplyPlan` if this option is enabled.

##### Examples

	SelectPlan plan1


## Dirigent.CLI Console Command Line Utility

 `Dirigent.CLI.exe` is specialized for sending commands to agents. It connects to the master via the TCP CLI interface and sends a command specified either on the command line.

    Dirigent.CLI.exe <command> <arg1> <arg2>; <command> <arg1>...

Zero exit code is returned on success, positive error code on failure.

For example:

    Dirigent.CLI.exe --masterIp 10.1.1.2 Start plan1; StartPlan plan2


Command can be also entered interactively from the console:

    Dirigent.CLI.exe --masterIp 10.1.1.2 --mode telnet

The commands are same as for the CLI TCP connection, see the command reference for examples.

Multiple commands on a single line can be separated by semicolon

    Dirigent.CLI.exe StartApp m1.a;StartPlan plan1



## CLI control over TCP line-based connection

Master is running a TCP server providing for controlling agents' operations.

To send a command open a TCP client connection to the master (server) and send the lines of text commands. Or use `Dirigent.CLI.exe` app sending the content of the command line to the master.

TCP server supports multiple simultaneous clients.

Server accepts single text line based requests from each client. Line separation character is `\n`.

Requests from different clients are buffered on the server in a single queue and processed sequentially in reception order. Response for a command may come later, after another commands have already been sent.

Each request can be optionally marked with request id. The request id is used to mark corresponding response lines.

For each request the server sends back one or more reply lines depending on the command type.

There is always a response to each command.  The client knows that the command was processed when a response with matching request id have arrived.

Clients can but do not need to wait for a response before sending another request. If the client marks each command with a unique request id, it can pair incoming response with corresponding request using provided request id.

##### Request line format:

  `[optional-req-id] request command text till the end of line\n`

##### Response line format:

  `[optional-req-id] response text till the end of line\n`


##### Response texts

  `ACK\n` ... Command reception was acknowledged, command was issued.

  `ERROR: error text here\n`

  `END\n` ..... Ends the list in case the command is expected to produce multiple line response

ACK does not mean that the command finished successfully! Only that it was delivered and processed.

Some commands do not return ERROR even if the command fails (but ACK is returned).
